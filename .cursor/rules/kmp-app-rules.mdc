# Project-Wide Rules for Cursor (KMP App)

- This project is a Kotlin Multiplatform app targeting Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web with a shared UI using Compose Multiplatform.
- Use Koin for dependency injection across all modules.
- Use Ktor for networking in shared code.
- Default to a standard Gradle KMP setup with Kotlin DSL (don’t suggest alternative build systems).
- Keep state management flexible — don’t enforce a specific pattern unless I specify later.
- Place platform-specific code in expect/actual blocks and keep shared code platform-agnostic.
- Prefer modern, stable libraries and APIs for all platforms unless I explicitly request experimental features.
